<h1>CSE-Analytics CoolTech challenge project</h1>

## Running locally
    * Make sure port 80 is not binded when running if it is change the port.
    * Fulfill the dependancies: I wrote a script, view the UpdatedScript folder within the repository or navigate to my scripts repository.
    * If you're running locally on Windows you need to install the dependancies same as Linux. The demo was was run on AWS'S image(Amazon's Linux). The local demo was run using Ubuntu/CentOS. I'll write a windows script soon.(The process is similar the only difference is some syntax and potential port issues).
    * If you're going to launch the website on Linux I wrote a bash script to auto install python 3.6 and the dependencies.
    * A local MongoDB instance is required unless you have one in the cloud or already running on another server. I've tested MongoDB on Linux and Windows its cross compatible. 
    * The main file is test3.py. To launch the website type "sudo python3 test.py"
